    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic itatlian, pasta dish that artfully combines humble ingredients to create a hearty, delicious dish.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 oz. Parmesan</li>
        <li>4 oz. guanciale, pancetta, or bacon</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. bucatini</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat water in pot over high. Add in the salt when the water starts to steam. Coer with a lid to bring it to a boil faster.</li>
        <li>Cut your choice of meat into 1x1/4th inch strips. Finely grate your cheese and set is aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks and whole eggs together until fully mixed. Add your grated cheese and a few turns of pepper. Leave some cheese leftover for garnish.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pan and add your meat to cook until crispy along the edges. 7-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from heat. Add 3 Tbsp. back to the pan. Discard extra fat if it will not be used for another dish.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta in poiling water, occasionally stirring. Remove the pasta ~2 minutes before cooking instructions advise. Save 1 and 3/4ths cups of pasta water with your heatproof measuring cup.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of pasta water to the pan and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Transfer drained pasta to pan.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta stirring vigorously until al dente and water has reduced by half. Remove pan from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1/4 cup pasta water into reserved egg mixture, then slowly stream into pan while constantly stirring. The cheese should melt and the eggs should thicken, but not cook. Season with salt if necessary. Thin the sauce with remaining pasta water one tablespoon at a time until sauce consistency matches heavy cream. you will likely have leftover pasta water.</li>
        <li>Mix in meat and serve in bowls. Top with pepper and reserved grated cheese.</li>
    </ol>
